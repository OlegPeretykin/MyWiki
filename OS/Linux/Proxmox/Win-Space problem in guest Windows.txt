For Windows 10:

go to Edit language and keyboard options -> Advanced Keyboard Settings -> Language Bar Options -> Advanced Key Settings
select Change Key Sequence for Between Input Languages
change "Switch Keyboard Layout" to "Not Assigned"
enjoy the good life.  The Windows+Space option still works; if you want that, see the upvoted answer.

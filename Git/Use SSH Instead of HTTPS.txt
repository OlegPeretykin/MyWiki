se SSH Instead of HTTPS
If you continue to have issues with HTTPS, consider using SSH for your Git operations. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

Generate an SSH Key (if you don't have one):

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Follow the prompts to save the key (default location is usually fine).

Add the SSH Key to Your GitHub Account:
Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
Then, go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key, and paste your key there.

Change the Remote URL to SSH:
Update your repository's remote URL to use SSH:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:OlegPeretykin/acq.git

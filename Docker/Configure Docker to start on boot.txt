Configure Docker to start on boot
Most current Linux distributions (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu 16.04 and higher) use systemd to manage which services start when the system boots. On Debian and Ubuntu, the Docker service is configured to start on boot by default. To automatically start Docker and Containerd on boot for other distros, use the commands below:

 sudo systemctl enable docker.service
 sudo systemctl enable containerd.service
To disable this behavior, use disable instead.

 sudo systemctl disable docker.service
 sudo systemctl disable containerd.service
